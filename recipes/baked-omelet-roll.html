      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="description">
        A baked omelet is a deliciously different way to serve eggs. The eggs
        bake in the oven, so you don't have to keep a constant eye on them like
        omelets made in a frying pan on the stove.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup 2% milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced green onions, optional</li>
      </ul>

          Place eggs and milk in a blender. Add the flour, salt and pepper;
          cover and process until smooth. Pour into a greased 13x9-in. baking
          pan. Bake at 375Â° until eggs are set, 20-25 minutes.

          Sprinkle with cheese. Roll up omelet in pan, starting with a short
          side. Place seam side down on a serving platter. Cut into 3/4-in.
          slices. If desired, sprinkle with green onions.
