    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A baked omelet is a deliciously different way to serve eggs. The eggs bake in the oven, so you don't have to keep a constant eye on them like omelets made in a frying pan on the stove.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup 2% milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>Thinly sliced green onions, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place eggs and milk in a blender. Add the flour, salt and pepper; cover and process until smooth. Pour into a greased 13x9-in. baking pan. Bake at 375° until eggs are set, 20-25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with cheese. Roll up omelet in pan, starting with a short side. Place seam side down on a serving platter. Cut into 3/4-in. slices. If desired, sprinkle with green onions.</li>
    </ol>
